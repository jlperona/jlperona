Hi!
I am a computer scientist currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area.
I received my Master's degree in Computer Science (2019) and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering (2016), both from [UC Davis](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/).

During my time at Davis, I taught computer architecture and computer science teaching pedagogy classes.
I was also an undergraduate and graduate peer adviser, advising university students of all types.
Significant portions of my work for both roles are open-source and available here on GitHub.

Feel free to [contact me](https://perona.dev/contact/) if you want to chat.
Cheers!
